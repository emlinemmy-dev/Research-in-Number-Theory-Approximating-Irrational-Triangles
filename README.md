# Approximating-Irrational-Triangles
This research examines the approximation of quadratic-irrational right triangles represented by the triple (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾) with 𝛼2 + 𝛽2 = 𝛾2 . I prove that there exists a characteristic equation 𝑝𝛼 + 𝑞𝛽 − 𝑟𝛾 = 0 with 𝑝,𝑞, and 𝑟 being  integers which encompasses the ratios of sides in the triangle.
